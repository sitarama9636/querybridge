Nissan Heritage
Since 1933, Nissan has been creating the kinds of cars that move people's
hearts. In our pursuit of this ideal, we have always challenged the limits of what is
possible by rejecting assumptions and turning conventional wisdom on its head.
Our history has seen us take on an endless series of challenges. Looking back
over those years, one can see that the challenges we have taken on have
centered on four main areas.
Sustainability
We have never lost sight of the importance of our relationship with society and
have always remained focused on the effects we have on people's lives. Thanks
to this approach, the innovations that we have made along the way have
sometimes transcended the realm of auto manufacturing and have brought about

--- Chunk 1 | ID: docs\Nissan Heritage.pdf:0:1 ---
sometimes transcended the realm of auto manufacturing and have brought about
wide-ranging societal changes. For example: zero emission vehicles. Nissan's
development of electric vehicles began with the Tama electric car. That work led
to today's Nissan LEAF and e-NV200 EVs.

Accessibility
Ever since Nissan's founding, we have placed importance on bringing the fun
and convenience of automobiles to all. With Datsun brand cars, we aimed to
enable each household to own their car by creating Japan's ﬁrst mass-produced
automobile, and these cars are now symbolic of that age. With the Nissan Z-car
series we also made owning a sports car something everyone could achieve.
Diversity
Learning from engineers from overseas, collaborating with companies with
differing areas of strength, and increasing Nissan's organizational and cultural
diversity have all contributed greatly to our auto manufacturing capabilities. More
than 80 years have passed since our founding, a time when we were striving
hard to learn from the cutting-edge technologies of companies outside Japan as

hard to learn from the cutting-edge technologies of companies outside Japan as
quickly as we could. Today, we have R&D bases located around the globe and
are therefore able to reﬂect the culture and preferences of local people in the
cars we create.
Passion
We are passionate about driving, not only with cars like the Skyline and GT-R,
but with all of the cars we produce. This passion grows more intense with the
passing of time. Through our long years of experience in motorsports, we have
learned a great deal about making cars that are faster, more beautiful, safer, more
responsive, and simply more fun to drive. Our passion is to create better cars for
our customers. We will continue to refuse to be beholden to conventional

our customers. We will continue to refuse to be beholden to conventional
wisdom. We are driven by the goal of moving people, moving their hearts, and
changing history; we will never cease in these efforts.
Nissan has been a pioneer in creating and developing electric vehicles (EV).
With 70 years of EV heritage, built on the legacy of Prince Motors, Nissan's goal
is to bring the beneﬁts of EV to more people in more places.

Datsun's roots go all the way back to 1914 when the Kwaishinsha Co.
manufactured their ﬁrst car, the DAT (D, A, and T being the initials of the three
investors). It was followed by a smaller car that was to be christened DATSON
(son of DAT), but because of the inauspicious associations of "son" (sounds like
the Japanese word for "loss"), this was changed to DATSUN when the vehicle
went on sale in 1932.

Nissan has been a pioneer in creating and developing electric vehicles (EV).
With 70 years of EV heritage, built on the legacy of Prince Motors, Nissan's goal
is to bring the beneﬁts of EV to more people in more places.
In 1947, the company succeeded in creating a prototype two-seater truck (with a
500-kg load capacity) with a 4.5-hp motor and a new body design. It was named
"Tama" after the area where it was produced. Its top speed was 34km/h. Next,
Nissan created its ﬁrst passenger car; with two doors and seating for four, it
boasted a top speed of 35km/h and a cruising range of 65km on a single charge.
While much has changed in design and technology since the Tama's debut, many
of the same features and beneﬁts remain and seen in the new Nissan LEAF.

Nissan Legend Hideaki Horie: EVs will accelerate the networking of
energy
Horie joined Nissan in 1985 and went to work on catalyzer development in the
company's Materials Laboratory. This was when there was a huge wave of
catalyzer development taking place all around the world. Porsche and BMW
were doing R&D on simple metal catalyzers, but Nissan developed and adopted
catalyzers ahead of all other automakers, using them in production vehicles like
the Skyline and the Laurel. Horie was involved in this R&D.

In 1910, Yoshisuke Aikawa was born in Yamaguchi prefecture. He
graduated from Tokyo Imperial University (present Tokyo University).
When he lived in the United States, Yoshisuke concealed his
academic accomplishments and worked in a factory, where he
developed casting skill. He established Tobata Casting Co., Ltd.,
after his return to Japan.
In 1911, Kwaishinsha Motor Car Works was established. Masujiro
Hashimoto led by establishing Kwaishinsha. The factory embarked
on domestic automobile production, which became the forerunner
of the domestic automobile industry.
In 1914, the DAT car was named by combining the initials of three men who
invested in Kwaishinsha: Den, Aoyama and Takeuchi. The DAT car was entered in
the Taisho Exposition held in the same year.

In 1931, DAT Jidosha Seizo Co., Ltd. became a subsidiary of Tobata Casting
Co., Ltd., and developed its ﬁrst 495cc compact size passenger vehicle. In the
following year, 1932, the company changed its name to Datsun: DAT was taken
from the initial letters of three men. The SON was changed to SUN, since the
SON sounded the same as a word meaning "disadvantage" in Japanese.
